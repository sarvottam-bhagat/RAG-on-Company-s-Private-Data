# RAG-Based Project QA System for Private Enterprise Data üîç

## üìö Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is revolutionizing how companies leverage their institutional knowledge. This project implements a RAG system that empowers organizations to unlock insights from their private internal data while maintaining data privacy and security.

### What is RAG?

RAG combines two powerful components:
1. **Retrieval**: Efficiently extracts relevant documents from your company's internal knowledge base
2. **Generation**: Uses advanced language models to create precise, contextual responses

### Business Value
- **Knowledge Discovery**: Quickly find relevant past projects and experiences
- **Informed Decision Making**: Learn from historical successes and failures
- **Productivity Enhancement**: Reduce time spent searching through documentation
- **Institutional Memory**: Preserve and easily access organizational knowledge
- **Privacy-First**: Process sensitive data locally within your network

## üåü Features

- **Smart Document Processing**: Efficiently handles internal project documentation
- **Vector Search**: Uses FAISS for lightning-fast similarity search
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Maintains conversation history for better understanding
- **Structured Output**: Organized response format including:
  - Project details
  - Algorithms attempted
  - Success metrics
  - Lessons learned
- **Privacy-Focused**: Runs LLM operations within your infrastructure
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive Streamlit-based UI
